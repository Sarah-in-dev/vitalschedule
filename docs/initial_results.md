# VitalSchedule: Initial Results

## Overview
This document summarizes the initial results of the VitalSchedule predictive no-show model development.

## Dataset
- **Size**: 10,000 synthetic appointments generated from 2,000 patients
- **Features**: 50 columns including patient demographics, appointment details, and environmental factors
- **Overall no-show rate**: ~70% (higher than real-world settings for demonstration purposes)

## Key Findings from Exploratory Analysis

### Top Factors Influencing No-Show Rates
1. **Previous no-show history** (69% range): Patients with prior no-shows are significantly more likely to miss future appointments
2. **Lead time** (31% range): Appointments scheduled further in advance have much higher no-show rates
3. **Appointment type** (9% range): Behavioral Health has the highest no-show rate at 77.2%
4. **Day of week** (7% range): Friday appointments have the highest no-show rate at 74.3%
5. **Distance from clinic** (5% range): Patients traveling longer distances show higher no-show rates

### Pattern Insights
- Appointments scheduled same-day have the lowest no-show rate (51.6%)
- Appointments scheduled 2-3 months in advance have the highest no-show rate (82.4%)
- Evening appointments have higher no-show rates than morning or afternoon appointments
- Age groups show some variation in no-show rates, with 65+ showing the highest rate in our synthetic data

## Predictive Model Performance

### Random Forest Model
- **Accuracy**: 90.10%
- **AUC**: 0.9501
- **Implementation**: 100 trees, max depth of 10

### XGBoost Model
- **Accuracy**: 89.95%
- **AUC**: 0.9693
- **Implementation**: 100 estimators, learning rate of 0.1

## Conclusions
1. The high predictive performance (AUC > 0.95) demonstrates that no-shows can be accurately predicted using available appointment and patient data.
2. Lead time and previous no-show history are the strongest predictors, suggesting targeted interventions for appointments scheduled far in advance and for patients with a history of no-shows.
3. Behavioral health appointments require special attention due to their higher no-show rates.

## Next Steps
1. Refine the synthetic data to more closely match real-world no-show patterns
2. Develop and test targeted intervention strategies based on predicted no-show risk
3. Create an ROI analysis framework to quantify the financial impact of reducing no-shows
4. Build a dashboard interface for demonstration
