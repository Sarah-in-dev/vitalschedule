# No-Show Research Summary

## Key Factors Affecting No-Show Probability

### Patient Demographics
- **Age**: Younger patients (18-30) have higher no-show rates than older patients
- **Distance**: Patients living further from clinic have higher no-show rates
- **Insurance**: Medicaid patients have higher no-show rates than privately insured
- **Socioeconomic status**: Lower SES correlates with higher no-show rates

### Appointment Characteristics
- **Lead time**: Longer wait times between scheduling and appointment increase no-show rates
- **Day of week**: Monday and Friday typically have higher no-show rates
- **Time of day**: Early morning and late afternoon appointments have higher no-show rates
- **Appointment type**: Behavioral health appointments have higher no-show rates than primary care

### Environmental Factors
- **Weather**: Extreme weather (heavy rain, snow, extreme heat) increases no-show rates
- **Transportation**: Limited public transit access correlates with higher no-show rates
- **Calendar events**: School holidays affect pediatric appointment attendance

### Patient History
- **Previous no-shows**: Strongest predictor of future no-shows
- **No-show streaks**: Multiple consecutive no-shows strongly predict future behavior
- **Appointment frequency**: Patients with infrequent appointments have higher no-show rates

## Effective Interventions

### Communication Strategies
- **Multiple reminders**: Incremental benefit for each additional reminder
- **Personalization**: Personalized messages more effective than generic ones
- **Interactive reminders**: Requesting confirmation improves attendance
- **Timing**: 24-48 hours before appointment is optimal for final reminder

### Barrier Reduction
- **Transportation assistance**: Offering rides or transit fare can reduce no-shows by 25-45%
- **Childcare options**: On-site childcare reduces no-shows for parents
- **Extended hours**: Evening and weekend appointments reduce no-shows for working patients

### Incentives and Consequences
- **Positive incentives**: Small incentives ($5-10 value) can reduce no-shows
- **No-show fees**: Mixed evidence on effectiveness, may deter future appointments
- **Educational outreach**: Educating on impact of no-shows shows modest benefit

## Technology Approaches

### Predictive Models
- **Machine learning**: Gradient boosting and random forest models outperform logistic regression
- **Feature importance**: Patient history and lead time consistently top predictors
- **Accuracy levels**: Best models achieve 75-85% accuracy in high-risk identification

### Implementation Considerations
- **Staff buy-in**: Critical success factor for intervention programs
- **Integration workflow**: Must minimize additional work for front-desk staff
- **Intervention targeting**: Focusing on highest-risk 20% of appointments optimizes ROI
