# VitalSchedule Client Presentation Script

## Introduction (2 minutes)

Thank you all for taking the time to meet with us today. We're excited to show you how Vital Care Innovations is addressing one of the most persistent challenges in community health centers: patient no-shows.

Before we dive into our solution, let's quickly understand the scale of this challenge:

- The average community health center experiences a 25-30% no-show rate
- Each missed appointment costs between $150-200 in direct revenue loss
- Additional costs come from provider idle time and administrative inefficiency
- Most importantly, no-shows disrupt continuity of care for your patients

What makes this problem particularly difficult is that traditional approaches like reminder calls and text messages only go so far. That's because they treat all appointments the same, rather than targeting the patients who are most likely to miss their appointments.

## VitalSchedule Solution Overview (3 minutes)

Our solution, VitalSchedule, takes a fundamentally different approach. Instead of reacting to no-shows after they happen, we use predictive analytics to prevent them before they occur.

VitalSchedule works in three key steps:

1. **Predict**: Our healthcare-specific AI model analyzes over 40 data points to identify which appointments are at high risk of becoming no-shows.

2. **Intervene**: The system recommends personalized interventions based on each patient's specific risk factors, focusing resources where they'll have the biggest impact.

3. **Optimize**: The system continuously learns from outcomes, improving its predictions and measuring ROI in real-time.

Let me show you how this works in practice.

## Operational Dashboard Demo (5 minutes)

[SHOW OPERATIONAL DASHBOARD - OVERVIEW TAB]

This is the VitalSchedule dashboard that your staff would use daily. The overview screen immediately shows you the appointments at risk today. You can see we have 3 high-risk patients, 2 medium-risk, and 3 low-risk appointments.

What makes this powerful is the "Today's Improvement Summary" section. Here you can see that without our system, you would expect about 2.2 no-shows today based on your baseline rate. With VitalSchedule's targeted interventions, we predict reducing that to 1.4, effectively saving 0.8 appointments and approximately $120 in revenue – just today.

The system automatically suggests targeted interventions. In this case, we have two urgent actions (calling Maria Garcia and arranging transportation for Emma Davis) and two important actions (sending SMS reminders to Alice and confirming with Thomas).

[SWITCH TO APPOINTMENTS TAB]

Let's look at the appointments in more detail. Each patient has a risk score showing their likelihood of missing their appointment. For example, Maria Garcia has an 82% chance of missing her behavioral health appointment today.

[CLICK ON MARIA GARCIA]

When we select Maria's appointment, we can see why the system flagged it as high-risk:
- She has previous no-shows in her history
- She's on Medicaid insurance, which our model knows correlates with transportation barriers
- Today's weather forecast is poor
- It's a Friday appointment, which statistically has higher no-show rates

Based on these specific factors, the system recommends targeted interventions:
1. A personal phone call rather than just an automated message
2. Transportation assistance to address her mobility barrier

These interventions are ranked by effectiveness, and the system only recommends those with a positive ROI.

[SWITCH TO INTERVENTIONS TAB]

What truly sets our system apart is its ability to track interventions and their outcomes. Here you can see recently completed interventions and their results. For example, a phone call reminder to Maria Garcia resulted in confirmed attendance.

Below, you can see the effectiveness rates of different intervention types. Transportation assistance has the highest success rate at 86%, while SMS reminders are effective about 55% of the time.

The system also shows how interventions work throughout the appointment lifecycle, from initial scheduling 14 days before the appointment through the final confirmation. Each phase contributes different levels of no-show reduction, with the barrier resolution phase showing the most impact at 40%.

[SWITCH TO IMPACT TAB]

The impact analysis shows you the concrete results achieved. Here you can see improvement by department – Behavioral Health has shown the most dramatic improvement, reducing no-shows from 40% to 24%.

You can also see the monthly impact summary: 86 appointments saved, $12,900 in revenue recovered, 43 provider hours saved, and 64 staff hours saved. These numbers directly translate to your bottom line.

Most importantly, the system continues to improve over time. You can see that prediction accuracy has improved from 76% at launch to 84% now, while the cost per intervention has decreased from $7.20 to $4.73.

## Advanced Predictive Analysis (5 minutes)

[SHOW PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS DASHBOARD - RISK PREDICTORS TAB]

Let's look more deeply at the advanced analytics that power VitalSchedule. What makes our solution unique is the breadth and depth of our predictive model.

Our system analyzes over 40 data points to create accurate predictions. Let me show you the key risk factors our AI evaluates.

Previous no-show history is the strongest predictor at 69% importance. But what makes our approach different is how we analyze this history. We don't just count no-shows – we look for patterns.

[CLICK ON "PREVIOUS NO-SHOW HISTORY"]

Our model analyzes the frequency, recency, and consistency of missed appointments. We track consecutive no-shows, look at service-specific patterns, and weight recent no-shows more heavily than older ones.

[SWITCH TO INTERVENTIONS TAB]

What truly sets VitalSchedule apart is our intelligent intervention engine. Rather than taking a one-size-fits-all approach, we customize interventions based on specific risk factors.

[CLICK ON "TRANSPORTATION ASSISTANCE"]

For patients with identified transportation barriers, we don't just flag the issue – we provide specific solutions. Our system can integrate with rideshare services, check eligibility for transportation benefits, and even adjust plans based on weather forecasts.

When you consider that transportation assistance can reduce no-shows by 40% for at-risk patients, the ROI becomes clear.

[SWITCH TO SEQUENCES TAB]

Finally, our system creates optimized interaction sequences for different patient profiles. Here you can see how we would approach a high-risk behavioral health patient with transportation barriers.

The system creates a strategic sequence of touchpoints, starting 14 days before the appointment and continuing through the day of service. Each interaction is designed to address specific barriers at the optimal time.

This personalized approach is far more effective than standard reminder calls, and it's all automated by the system.

## ROI Demonstration (5 minutes)

[SHOW ROI CALCULATOR]

Let's talk about the financial impact. This calculator lets us model the ROI based on your specific parameters.

For a typical community health center with:
- 50,000 annual visits (medium-sized CHC)
- 25% no-show rate
- $150 average revenue per visit

Our solution can reduce no-shows by 30%, which means:
- 3,750 additional appointments attended annually
- $562,500 in direct revenue recovery
- Plus significant additional benefits:

Looking at the benefits breakdown, you can see that beyond direct revenue, there are substantial operational benefits:
- Provider productivity improvement: approximately $281,000
- Front desk efficiency gains: approximately $92,000
- Reduced overtime: approximately $45,000
- Improved collections and payer mix: approximately $600,000
- Patient retention value: approximately $112,000

The total annual benefit exceeds $1.6 million.

When we account for implementation costs of $450,000 and annual maintenance of $95,000, you reach a positive ROI in month 18 and achieve a 244% return over three years.

The 5-year financial projection shows that after recovering the initial investment, you'll generate consistently strong positive returns in years 2-5, culminating in a cumulative benefit of over $4.8 million.
